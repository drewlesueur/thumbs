TODO:

*****
Reimplement the whole thing using simple gotos and create your own stack etc,
That will allow you to do tail call optimization
Reimplement in subset of thumbs that will be easy to convert to other languages
You may need to convert nested calls out.
Based on gotos.
****

lists
splats
make functions able to be called with . and :
add reference to caller scope
ability to set parent on object to lookup
property missing object?prop
conect everything by function calls
change it so when you call a js function you also pass in scope
maybe a % operator that allows you to do
  math equations
  like:
  answer % -b + (sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)) / 2a
  with parens, order of operations, everyting

Convert js args to thumbs args
  arrays and objects --> thumbs lists and maps
non interpolating strings

objects as keys
create a new function with scope
dynamically set a variable to the current scope
maybe one more level of indirection for strings and numbers?

space character
more library calls (use @caolan's async.js)
